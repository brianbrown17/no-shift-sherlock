# No Shift Sherlock

### Overview:
This project draws inspiration from 'Would It Dong?' The viral project that uses statcast data to predict how many other MLB parks a home run would have 'donged'.

It uses a ML classifier to look at MLB hits and predict whether they would have been outs against a conventional infield shift (banned in 2022).
